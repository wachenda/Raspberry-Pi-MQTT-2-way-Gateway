# Raspberry-Pi-MQTT-2-way-Gateway

This code was modified from code originially done by Andre Bouillot which is located in his github at
[abouillot/HomeAutomation/piGateway](https://github.com/abouillot/HomeAutomation/tree/master/piGateway).

My modified version provides 2-way communcation between the MQTT server and nodes on my RMF69 home automation network.
These nodes are Moteino's with the RFM69HW radio.
